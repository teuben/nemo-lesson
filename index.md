> ## Prerequisites
>
> You will need a Unix environment with an interactive terminal (Linux, Mac, Windows/WSL).
> For plotting you can optionally use X-windows, though PNG or PS files
> can be created for off-line viewing. 
>
> Obviously you will need an installed version of NEMO, though one of the
> lesson episodes (#3) will install NEMO from scratch if you have its prerequisites
> (a C/C++/Fortran compiler, the make tool, csh/bash, pgplot, X11). It is possible
> to install NEMO without a Fortran compiler, and without csh, pgplot and X11,
> though obviously with less functionality.
>
> Not neccessarely prerequisites, the following Software Carpentry lessons will likely
> benefit you in your work with NEMO:
>
> * [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice) 
> * [Extra Unix Shell Material](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/shell-extras)
> * [Version control with git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice)
> * [Automation and Make](http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice)
> * [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/good-enough-practices)
