> ## Prerequisites
>
> You will need a unix (like) environment with an interactive terminal (Linux, Mac, Windows/WSL).
> For plotting you can optionally use X-windows, though PNGs can be created for off-line viewing.
>
> Obviously you will need an installed version of NEMO, though one of the
> lesson episodes (#3) will install NEMO from scratch if you have its prerequisites
> (a C/C++/Fortran compiler, the make tool, csh/bash, pgplot, X11). It is possible
> to install NEMO without a Fortran compiler, and without csh, pgplot and X11.
