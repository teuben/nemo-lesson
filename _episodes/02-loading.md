In this lesson we will load NEMO into your shell environment.

It is assumed somebody
has already installed NEMO. The only thing we need to know is the root directory where
NEMO has been installed.
So let us assume somebody told us that NEMO has been installed in
/opt/nemo_4.1.1. The following command would then load NEMO into your shell

~~~
$ source /opt/nemo_4.1.1/nemo_start.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}
