### Background

As soon as computers became available to the research community in the 50s, astronomers
tackled the problem how to compute the orbits of stars or planets in their common environment
under their common force of gravity: the N-body problem.

The first programs were written in FORTRAN (von Hoerner, Aarseth, van Albada and many others)

### NEMO

NEMO is a software environment to enable you to do Stellar Dynamics.
